I am Ontlametse Molete, a passionate marketing professional with a deep interest in marketing technology (MarTech) and data science. I hold a Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing Management, and I’m dedicated to leveraging my skills in digital marketing, content creation, and social media management to help businesses grow. Currently, I’m building my own lead generation business, Finbona, where I help financial advisors generate high-quality leads through targeted landing pages and digital campaigns.
With hands-on experience in tools like Google Ads and Meta Ads, I’ve developed a strong ability to optimize campaigns and improve customer engagement. I’ve also worked as a digital marketing intern at DigiTyza, where I focused on content creation, market research, and social media management, sharpening my skills in campaign management and analytics. I am eager to continue developing my expertise, particularly in the intersection of marketing and technology, and aspire to make a meaningful impact in the field of marketing and business growth.
